### Tips
- Finding Counterexamples When Some Test Cases Fail
    - Make sure that the last index works correctly if there is a for loop (problem: lv2 - 11)
- Calculating All Possible Combinations by Handling Edge Cases
    - Calculate all possible combinations first and then handle any exceptions to simplify problem-solving (problem: lv2 - 10)
- In algorithm coding tests where you need to manually implement data structures in JavaScript, use another language (such as Python) instead of JavaScript. (problem: lv2 - 12)

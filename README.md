### Tips
- Finding Counterexamples When Some Test Cases Fail
    - Make sure that the last index works correctly if there is a for loop (problem: lv2 - 11)
- Calculating All Possible Combinations by Handling Edge Cases
    - Calculate all possible combinations first and then handle any exceptions to simplify problem-solving (problem: lv2 - 10)
- If it is the case that you fail the efficiency test and need to implement a specific data structure algorithm yourself (in JavaScript)
    - It is recommended to solve it using a language that provides data structure algorithm libraries, such as Python or Java (e.g., Heap Sort)(problem: lv2 - 12)
- If more than half of the test cases fail
    - Reconsider the approach (problem: lv2 - 13)
